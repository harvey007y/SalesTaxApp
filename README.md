# SalesTaxApp
<p align="center"><strong>Demonstrates using WPF Datagrid to Calculate Sales Tax</strong></p> 
<br /><br />
<strong>The application demonstrates adding new rows, updating rows, and deleting them. It also uses validation to check input into the datagrid cells. Finally, it allows one to print the data grid along with the total sum of taxes and item prices. Unit tests are used to demonstrate that application meets acceptance criteria.</strong>
<br /><br />
Here are the requirements:
<br /><br />
There are a variety of items for sale at a store. When a customer purchases items, they receive a receipt. The
receipt lists all of the items purchased, the sales price of each item (with taxes included), the total sales taxes for
all items, and the total sales price.
<br /><br />
Basic sales tax applies to all items at a rate of 10% of the itemâ€™s list price, with the exception of books, food, and
medical products, which are exempt from basic sales tax. An import duty (import tax) applies to all imported items
at a rate of 5% of the shelf price, with no exceptions.
<br /><br />
Write an application that takes input for shopping baskets and returns receipts in the format shown below,
calculating all taxes and totals correctly. When calculating prices plus tax, round the total up to the nearest 5
cents. For example, if a taxable item costs $5.60, an exact 10% tax would be $0.56, and the final price after adding
the rounded tax of $0.60 should be $6.20.
